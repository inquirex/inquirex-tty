# Example 8: Tax Preparer Intake (Realistic, Privacy-Safe)
#
# Real-world intake wizard used by tax preparers to estimate how long a
# return will take and how much phone time the client will consume. Every
# question is scoped so the answer changes the fee quote.
#
# Privacy rule: this form lives on an unsecured embeddable widget, so we
# collect NO PII — no names, no SSN / ITIN, no date of birth, no addresses,
# no account numbers. The only contact field is an email so we can send
# the quote back. Everything else is bucketed multiple choice.
#
# The flow branches on:
#
#   * residency status (non-resident / dual-status multiplies the fee),
#   * business ownership (entity mix, employee / contractor bands, and
#     which books — P&L, Balance Sheet, GL, Trial Balance — are ready),
#   * investment, crypto, rental, and foreign-earned income blocks,
#   * the "surprise pile" (IRS letters, state notices) that blows up
#     timelines if not flagged early.
#
# Bucketed `enum` and `multi_enum` options are used everywhere so a
# downstream pricing pass can `accumulate` fees per selected option.
